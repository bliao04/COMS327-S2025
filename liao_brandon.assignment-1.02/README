This program generates a random 80x21 dungeon layout with rooms, corridors, and staircases. Rooms placed until the maximum number of rooms have been 
placed or the maximum number of attempts has been reached and an x/y coordinate pathing algorithm is used to connect rooms. Staircases are randomly placed
on floor tiles within the dungeon (currently only 1 up and down staircase). 
This iteration of the dungeon generator implements file saving and loading using endian conversions to ensure all data is written in network order.
This iteration also contains hardness values for tiles within the dungeon with all corridors set at a hardness value of 0 and all walls set with a 
hardness value of 255. 

Users should compile the code with the following format: gcc dungeon_generator.c -o dungeon_generator -lm -Wall -Werror
Or use the Makefile with the following format: make dungeon_generator
Users should run the program with the following formats: 
./dungeon_generator to generate a random dungeon.
./dungeon_generator --save to generate a random dungeon and save to file.
./dungeon_generator --load to to load the dungeon from file.
