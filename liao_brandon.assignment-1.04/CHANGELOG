3/3: 4:00 PM: Functional generation of monsters w/ binary characteristics in dungeon, improvements on characteristic logic.
3/3 5:00 PM: Fixed a bug where non-tunneling monsters could be generated outside of a room, and tunneling monsters could be generated in the same rooms as the pc.
3/3 6:30 PM: Functional turn implementation w/ drunken roving idiot pc movement, dungeon is printed for every pc move.
3/4 4:00 PM: Slight tweaks to read and write to file functions.
