4/26 1:00 PM: Implemented most of RANGED attack logic in process_pc_input (cursor system similar to teleport), added range and damage calculation to RANGED attack logic. 
4/26 3:00 PM: Added AMMUNITION logic to RANGED attacks, added inventory selection, damage calculation, and AMMUNITION consumption.
4/26 3:30 PM: Added a simple targeting info display to RANGED attack mode.
